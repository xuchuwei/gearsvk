![GearsVK](docs/gearsvk.gif?raw=true "GearsVK")

GearsVK is a modern port of the classic OpenGL 'gears' demo
to Vulkan using the VKK library. Designed as a learning
resource for developers, this project provides a clear and
concise demonstration of core Vulkan concepts. Building upon
Brian Paul's original OpenGL implementation, GearsVK offers
a solid foundation for understanding Vulkan graphics
programming.

Beyond the core demo, this repository includes additional
branches showcasing advanced techniques like upscaling and
super sampling, as well as a detailed Vulkan tutorial for
beginners. I hope GearsVK becomes an invaluable resource for
aspiring graphics developers to learn about graphics and the
Vulkan API.

Setup
=====

Clone Project
-------------

Clone the GearsVK project https://github.com/jeffboody/gearsvk.

	git clone git@github.com:jeffboody/gearsvk.git
	git checkout -b main origin/main
